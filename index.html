      <P><A HREF="http://www.mongodb.org">mongo</A> is a scalable, high-performance, open source, schema-free, document-oriented database. I was introduced to mongo at the <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/mysqlnyc/messages/8346727/">new-york mysql meetup</A>. Two things made mongo look attractive: inter-operability and document centric storage. <BR> <BR> I'm familiar with the <A HREF="http://common-lisp.net/project/elephant/">elephant</A> persistence framework in lisp. However elephant objects are not readable (as far as I know) in languages other than lisp.That makes inter-operating with other platforms difficult. A traditional rdms requires some sort of schema if you want to use it effectively. Mongo on the other hand is optimized for the the kind of free form document storage I'm looking for. <BR> <BR> Mongo comes with set of drivers but was missing was a lisp driver. This looked like a good project to get better acquainted with lisp and mongo.<BR> <BR> So I set out to try to write one and the result is <A HREF="http://github.com/fons/cl-mongo">cl-mongo</A>.

    <div id="post-intro">
      <P>Friday I attended the 4<SUP> th</SUP>  Machine Learning Symposium organized by the New York Academy of Sciences <A HREF="http://www.nyas.org/">(NYSA)</A>.  <BR> <BR>  The <A HREF="http://www.nyas.org/events/Detail.aspx?cid=533f8dfe-d778-4c52-ba1b-3241bc9c8ca2">Symposium program</A> consisted of four main talks given by local experts in the area of machine learning, interspersed with four graduate student talks, a poster session and a terrific lunch. <BR> <BR>  Since I'm not really hindered by any overwhelming expertise in this area I'll confine my self to a few breezy impressions of the main talks.  <BR> <BR>  The first one was given by Bob Bell, from AT&amp;T Bell Labs and a member of the team which won the <A HREF="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix prize.</A><BR> <BR>  </P><P>What made the contest challenging was not only the huge size of the data set  but also the fact that 99 % of the data was missing. In addition there were significant differences between training and test data. Regardless of whether a 10 % improvement of a movie rating system should be worthy of a million dollar prize, it provided a great way to test classifiers against real world data.<BR> <BR>  One thing that stood out for me  was that a relative small amount of users was responsible for 'most' of the ratings. He mentioned that they identified one user responsible for 5400 ratings on one particular day. This <EM>could</EM> an data error on the Netflix side, where the time stamp was somehow misapplied. On the other hand it sounds like someone was trying to deliberately affect a large swath of ratings.  <BR> <BR>  The final classifier incorporated breakthroughs made by different teams in the earlier stages of this multi-year competition.One such breakthrough was to consider the previous genres of the movies someone has rated to determine future recommendations. That must seem rather obvious in retrospect. The other was a clever way called <A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1557072">Collaborative Filtering</A> which takes into account the time-dependency of people's movie preferences. <BR> <BR>  An ensemble of previously validated classifiers was used to construct the final classifier and the calculation to get the final result submitted to Netflix took almost a month, primarily because a power failure forced a restart of the calculation engine. In fact the use of an ensemble of classifiers of mentioned as one of the main lessons learned from the contest. The other was the power matrix factorization (i.e. treating users and preferences as independent parameters and using matrix to link the two) as a computational tool. </P>

Although those will never look as good in html as in Latex, the overall format of your text will suffer less.<BR> <BR> For equation blocks you have the choice between two online editors : <A HREF="http://www.sitmo.com/latex/">SITMO</A>, <A HREF="http://www.codecogs.com/components/equationeditor/equationeditor.php">CodeCogs</A>. When it comes to embedding latex code into your html both editors are comparable.

    <div id="post-intro">
      <P>In a <A HREF="http://www.prognotes.com/threading-the-sieve-in-python.html">previous post</A> I discussed four methods to multi-thread the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Erasthones</A> in Python. I concluded that multi-threading didn't increase performance, and in fact could have a significant adverse effect. The <A HREF="www.dabeaz.com/python/GIL.pdf">global interpretor lock (GIL)</A> prevents threads from running concurrently and thus limits the upside of threading. The use of locks or avoiding the use of shared data can than decrease performance quite a bit. <BR> <BR>  In this section I'll be using Python's <A HREF="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</A> module to 'multi-thread' the <EM>Sieve</EM>. <BR> <BR>  The multiprocessing module spawns a number of processes and distributes the calculation amongst them.There is no equivalent to the GIL so I should be able to see some gain in performance as the number of processes increases. On the other hand, spawning processes means that there is startup overhead which may offset any performance gain due to the distribution of its execution across multiple processes.  However, I should still be able to investigate how performance scales with the number of processes, and whether the <A HREF="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing module</A> is able to take advantage of multiple cores. In this post I'll discuss four approaches to distributing the <EM>Sieve</EM> algorithm, basically following the approaches I discussed <A HREF="http://www.prognotes.com/threading-the-sieve-in-python.html">earlier</A> when using the multi-threading package.The various approaches differ in the way the load is balanced and whether the state of the sieve is shared.<BR> <BR>  The source for the code discussed here and in the  <A HREF="http://www.prognotes.com/threading-the-sieve-in-python.html">previous post</A> can be found in  <EM>prime_share.py</EM> in the <A HREF="git://github.com/fons/blog-code.git">blog-code package</A> on github. </P>

      <P>This is the first of two posts on threading and multiprocessing in Python. In this post I'll explore the thread module and in the second post I'll look at Python's multiprocessing module. My starting point is the multi-threaded implementation of the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Erasthones</A> found in this <A HREF="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/Python/PyThreads.pdf">tutorial on multi-threading in Python (pdf).</A><BR> <BR> Threading a compute-bound algorithm, like the <EM>Sieve</EM> consists of subdividing of the main task into autonomous sub-tasks which share as little state as possible. Having no shared state eliminates the overhead that inevitably comes with locking. It turns out that Python is not very good at multi-threading compute-bound processes. <A HREF="http://www.dabeaz.com/blog/dablog.html">This </A><A HREF="http://ttimo.vox.com/library/post/python-gil-threading-and-multicore-hardware.html">is </A><A HREF="http://www.grouplens.org/node/244">not a </A><A HREF="http://blog.ianbicking.org/gil-of-doom.html">surprise.</A>  CPython has a global interpretor lock <A HREF="http://www.dabeaz.com/python/GIL.pdf">(GIL)</A> which prevents threads from running concurrently. <BR> <BR>  Regardless, there are other lessons I learned when multi-threading the <EM>Sieve</EM> algorithm. One is that sharing state between threads may be unavoidable to achieve reasonable performance. In fact, if you <EM>don't</EM> share state, performance can become predictable <EM>worse</EM> as the number of threads of execution increases. <BR> <BR> The other is that locking can have a surprising impact on performance.

      <P>Am I the only one in the world who feels that using python's  <EM>getopt</EM> is a bit of a struggle ? It involves a lot of boiler plate. Tedious refactoring is required each time you add or change an option.  This is not specific to Python, as most languages have a similar facility to parse the command line, which is similarly annoying. <BR> <BR>  I decided to create an easier way to process command line options, by transforming the command line into an immutable (read-only) object.

The value of the option flag is a concatenation of everything that follows it, until the next flag is encountered.  A simple option flag is one without explicit values and is considered a boolean flag, set to <EM>True</EM>. <A HREF="http://github.com/fons/dyn_options/tree/master">dyn_options</A> creates a read-only object, with attributes and values set to the command line option flags and values respectively. <BR> <BR>  So, '--opt4 hello world' will be converted to an option flag  called <EM>opt4</EM>, with a value of <EM>hello world</EM>.

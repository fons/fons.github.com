	  <h2> cl-mongo now on multiple lisps.  </h2>
	</div>
	<div id="post-intro">
	  <p><a href="http://github.com/fons/cl-mongo">cl-mongo</a>    now runs in the following lisp images : <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">sbcl</a>,  <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">clisp</a>, <a href="http://www.franz.com/products/allegrocl/">allegro common lisp</a> and <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/ccl">clozure common lisp</a>. I was not able to get it working with <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/">armed bear common lisp</a>.I originally used sbcl to develop cl-mongo, but it is my goal to be able to run it on most lisps. <br> <br> To get <a href="http://github.com/fons/cl-mongo">cl-mongo</a> to run with clisp I needed to make only one fairly minor change in the networking code.<br> <br> When you send an insert to mongodb, it does not respond back. When you send a query request you obviously do get a response back. Since I'm using the same socket connection for writes and reads I need to have some mechanism in place to wait for a response, when one is expected. A blocking read on the socket is out of the question. That would destroy performance. </p>

	<div id="post-body">
	  <p>I 'm using <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/api-docs.shtml">usocket</a> as  my socket api. usocket's api description recommends <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_listen.htm">listening</a> on the socket stream. This worked fine under sbcl. <br><a href="http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/non-block-io.html">clisp's implementation of listen</a> however does not support this sort of functionality for binary streams. Instead I use <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/socket.html#so-status">clisp's socket status</a>.<br> <br> clozure common lisp was not happy with my use of <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_call_n.htm">call-next-method</a> in cl-mongo's db.find implementation. Rather than rely on clos to string subsequent calls together, I used an explicit call to db.find. Lastly, clozure has it's own implementation of cwd, so I 'm no longer exporting  this for clozure. I use cwd to return the name of the current database in cl-mongo.<br> <br> Armed bear common lisp doesn't compile the <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/babel/">babel package.</a>I use this package to generate utf-8 compatible strings, and that's pretty essential as mongodb expects all strings to be utf-8 encoded.<br> <br> Finally, allegro lisp had no problems compiling and running cl-mongo. </p>

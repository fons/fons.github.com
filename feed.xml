      <title> CL-BLIKY : A simple lisp based blog engine </title>
      <link> http://fons.github.com/cl-bliky--a-simple-lisp-based-blog-engine.html </link>
      <description> I 'm writing this using a self rolled blog engine called cl-bliky. I'm indebted to an excellent 
[tutorial](http://roeim.net/vetle/docs/cl-webapp-intro/) 
put together by [Vetle Roeim](http://roeim.net/vetle/). 
His goal was obviously to put together a compelling tutorial and he succeeded. 
My goal was to use lisp in a small programming project, and developing a simple and easily 
customizable blog engine seemed like a good start. </description>

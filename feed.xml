      <title> CL-BLIKY </title>
      <link> http://fons.github.com/cl-bliky.html </link>
      <description> I 'm writing this using a self rolled blog engine called cl-bliky. I'm indebted to an excellent 
[tutorial](http://roeim.net/vetle/docs/cl-webapp-intro/) put together by [Vetle Roeim](http://roeim.net/vetle/). 
Vetle's goal was obviously to put together a compelling tutorial and he succeeded. 
I had different goals. </description>
